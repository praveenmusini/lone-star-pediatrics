                                    Each year, thousands of young children are killed or injured in car crashes. Proper
                                    use of car safety seats helps keep children safe. But, because so many different
                                    seats are on the market, many parents find this overwhelming. If you are expectant
                                    parents, consider working with a certified passenger safety technician (CPST or CPS
                                    technician), before your baby is born, to ensure a safe ride home from the hospital

                                Car safety seats may be installed with either the vehicle’s seat belt or its LATCH
                                (lower anchors and tethers for children) system. LATCH is an attachment system for car
                                safety seats. Lower anchors can be used instead of the seat belt to install the seat,
                                and many parents find them easier to use in some cars. The top tether should always be
                                used with a forward-facing seat, whether you use the seat belt or lower anchors to
                                secure it. The seat belt and LATCH systems are equally safe, so caregivers should use
                                one or the other, whichever works best for them, for their car safety seat, and their
                                vehicle. In general, caergivers should only use 1 of the 2 opions unless the car safety
                                seat and vehicle manufacturers say it is OK to use 2 systems at the same time.

                                Vehicles with the LATCH system have lower anchors located in the back seat, where the
                                seat cushions meet. Tether anchors are located behind the seat, either on the panel
                                behind the seat (in sedans) or on the back of the seat, ceiling, or floor (in most
                                minivans, SUVs, hatchbacks, and pickup trucks). All forward-facing car safety seats have
                                tethers or tether connectors that fasten to these anchors. Nearly all passenger vehicles
                                and all car safety seats made on or after Sepember 1, 2002, are equipped to use LATCH.

                                If you install a car safety seat by using your vehicle's seat belt, you must make sure
                                the seat belt locks to hold the seat tightly. In most newer cars, you can lock the seat
                                belt by pulling it all the way out and then allowing it to retract to keep the seat belt
                                tight around the car safety seat. In addition, many car safety seats have built-in
                                lock-offs so you can lock the belt without having to lock the seat belt separately as
                                well. Refer to the vehicle owner's manual for details about how your seat belt locks.

                                The safest place to ride for all children younger than 13 years is the back seat. If
                                possible, it may be best for the child to ride in the middle of the back seat. However,
                                it is sometimes difficult to install a car safety seat tightly in the middle if the
                                vehicle seat is narrow or uneven. Also, many vehicles do not have lower anchors for the
                                middle seating position. It is safest to put the car safety seat in a position where you
                                can install it tightly with either the lower anchor system or the seat belt; in some
                                cases, this position may be on either side of the back seat rather than in the middle. A
                                child passenger safety technician (CPST or CPS technician) can help you decide which
                                place is best to install your child's car safety seat in your vehicle

                                The AAP recommends that all infants ride rear facing starting with their first ride home
                                from the hospital. All infants and toddlers should ride in a rear-facing seat as long as
                                possible until they reach the highest weight or height allowed by their car safety seat
                                manufacturer. Most convertible seats have limits that will allow children to ride rear
                                facing for 2 years or more. When infants outgrow their rear-facing–only seat, a
                                convertible seat installed rear facing is needed. All parents can benefit from getting
                                installation help from a CPST to ensure that their child’s seat is properly installed

                                    is placed at the center of the chest, even with your child's armpits.

                                    Make sure the car safety seat is installed tightly in the vehicle with either lower
                                    anchors or a locked seat belt. Many car safety seats have an integrated lock-off
                                    system to keep the seat belt locked. If your seat has one, follow the manufacturer's
                                    recommendations on how to use it. If you can move the seat at the belt path more
                                    than an inch side to side or front to back, it's not tight enough.

                                This is a very common concern of parents, but it should cause them no worry. Children
                                are very flexible and can always easily find a comfortable position in a rear-facing
                                seat. Injuries to the legs are very rare for children facing the rear.

                                Bulky clothing, including winter coats and snowsuits, can compress in a crash and leave
                                the straps too loose to restrain your child, leading to increased risk of injury.
                                Ideally, dress your baby in thinner layers and wrap a coat or blanket around your baby
                                over the buckled harness straps if needed.See Winter Car Seat Safety Tips from the AAP

                                age. If your child outgrows a seat before reaching 4 years of age, consider using a seat
                                with a harness approved for higher weights and heights.

                                    Always use the tether when you can. A tether is a strap that is attached to the top
                                    part of a car safety seat and holds the seat tightly by connecting to an anchor
                                    point in your vehicle (often on the seat back or rear shelf; see your vehicle
                                    owner's manual to find where tether anchors are in your vehicle). Tethers give
                                    important extra protection by keeping the car safety seat and your child's head from
                                    moving too far forward in a crash or sudden stop. All new cars, minivans, and light
                                    trucks are required to have tether anchors as of September 2000. Forward-facing
                                    seats come with tether straps. A tether should always be used as long as your child
                                    has not reached the top weight limit for the tether anchor. Check the car safety
                                    seat instructions and vehicle owner’s manual for information about the top weight
                                    limit and locations of tether anchors.

                                    No, these products are unapproved and should not be used. They may actually
                                    interfere with proper seat belt fit by causing the lap belt to ride too high on the

                                    This rule applies to car safety seats too; do not use extra products unless they

                                    their size, they should not need to use additional devices

                                Front airbags are installed in all new cars. When used with seat belts, airbags work
                                well to protect teenagers and adults; however, airbags can be very dangerous to
                                children, particularly to those riding in rear-facing seats and to preschoolers and
                                young school-aged children who are not properly restrained. If your vehicle has a front
                                passenger airbag, infants in rear-facing seats must ride in the back seat. Even in a
                                relatively low-speed crash, the airbag can inflate, strike the car safety seat, and
                                cause serious brain injury and death.

                                Read your seat’s instruction manual and look for a label on the car safety seat that
                                says, “This restraint is certified for use in motor vehicles and aircraft.” You can also
                                consider using a restraint made only for use on airplanes and approved by the FAA.
                                Larger children may use the airplane seat belt or continue to use their car safety seat
                                on the airplane as long as it is labeled for use on aircraft and the child has not
                                exceeded the seat’s weight or height limit. Remember that your child will need an
                                appropriate car safety seat to use at your destination. For more information, visit the
                                FAA Website or the CARES (Airplane Safety Harness for Children) Website.

                    Be a good role model. Make sure you always wear your seat belt. This will help your child form a

                    Make sure that everyone who transports your child uses the correct car safety seat or seat belt on
                    every trip, every time. Being consistent with car safety seat use is good parenting, reduces fussing
                    and complaints, and is safest for your child.

                    Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions for your car safety seat. If you do not have
                    those, write or call the company's customer service department. Staff will ask you for the model
                    number, name of seat, and date of manufacture. The manufacturer's address and phone number are on a
                    label on the seat. Also, be sure to follow the instructions in your vehicle owner's manual about
                    using car safety seats. Some manufacturers' instructions may be available on their websites.

                    Remember to fill out and mail in the registration card that comes with the car safety seat. You can
                    also register your seat on the manufacturer's website. It will be important in case the seat is
                    recalled.

                <p class="pb-2 text-dark-grey">
                    Follow manufacturer directions for cleaning car seats. Cleaning but not disinfecting is usually
                    permitted. That's because disinfectant products may decrease the protection provided by the seat and
